# Analysis Tab: Pagination for "By Hero" List

## Problem

The "By Hero" list on the Analysis tab can be long, pushing the other charts below the fold and making them hard to discover.

## Solution

Add pagination (or a "show more" / page controls) to the By Hero list so the section has a fixed height and doesn't push other charts off-screen.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] By Hero list shows a limited number of rows per page (e.g. 10)
- [ ] Page controls (prev/next or numbered) allow navigating through heroes
- [ ] Other charts below the By Hero section remain visible without excessive scrolling
