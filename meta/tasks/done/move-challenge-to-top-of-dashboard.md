# Move Weekly Challenges to Top of Dashboard UI

## Problem Statement

The weekly challenges widget is currently positioned below other dashboard content. Since it's a time-sensitive, action-oriented feature, it should be the first thing the user sees when opening the app.

## Requirements

- Move the "Weekly Challenges" card to the top of the dashboard (`/` route, `+page.svelte`)
- It should appear above the goal calendar, hero suggestion, and any other widgets
- Keep all existing functionality intact

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Weekly challenges widget appears at the top of the dashboard
- [ ] All other widgets remain below it in their existing order
- [ ] No visual regressions
